# Topological Data Analysis with Python Workshop

This workshop provides a brief introduction to the theory of TDA as well as computational tools available in Python for one to carry out computations involving TDA. The target audience is for people with intermediate skill levels in at least one programming language who wish to learn the basics of TDA using Python.

## Notebooks

The included notebooks build upon each other in the following order and cover these topics:

* Brief introduction to Python as it pertains to the workshop -- `Introduction_To_Python.ipynb`
* Introduction to Topological Data Analysis and Ripser -- `Interactive_Ripser_Workshop.ipynb`

## Data

The data sets used in the `Interactive-Ripser-Workshop.ipynb` are located in the `data` folder.<br><br>
**Note**: To download the `Bailarina02_Repaired.stl` file used in the `Interactive-Ripser-Workshop.ipynb`, please go to https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2679412/files and select the tab named `Files`, from there you will be able to download the required `stl` file.
